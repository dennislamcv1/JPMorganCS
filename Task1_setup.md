# Exploratory Data Analysis

Install Python3 in case it is not installed on your machine. Type python or python3 in your terminal of choice. You should see the Python interpreter show up. Next, we will want environment isolation so this project can be separate from the rest of your machine. You can do one of the following:

```
- Install Anaconda / Miniconda. Once installed
    - conda create --name forageenv python=3.9
    - conda activate forageenv
- Use venv
    - python3 -m venv forageenv
    - source forageenv/bin/activate
- Use another tool you are comfortable with
    - use it as your normally would
```


Install the required Python modules.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
